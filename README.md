## About
- It simply loads **Total COVID19 cases in India**  
- It notifies total cases of COVID19 in India after every 1 hours.
- It is offline capable (Using Cache) 😃.

*It uses `PeriodicWorkManager` which is scheduled at the first run of an app. After that, `Worker` will execute after every one hour of interval and will show notification on Android's system tray.*
